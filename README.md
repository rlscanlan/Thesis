All of these scripts were used in the Thesis titled 'Using systems biology to explore temporal changes in human fibroblast cellular senescence' by Rebekah-Louise Anne Scanlan as part of her PhD at Newcastle University.

The following files were used for downloading, processing and formation of the SenOmic database:
DownloadData.R, Combine_data2_RS.R, eset.R, fastqc.R, quant_salmon_Sen23samples.sh, and RNAseq_processing_Rebekah.R.

Thesis.R and NewSenAnalysis_RS_20234.R contain all code used to analyse SenOmic in Chapters 3 and 4.

ModelA.py, ModelB.py, and CellularSenPaper.py are all python crips to run the computational model. datafiles_graphs.R was used to then visualise the model outputs in R. This work is presented in Chapter 5.

RS_Enrichment_analysis_APTXwork.R is the script used for work in Chapter 6.
