All of these scripts were used in the Thesis titled 'Using systems biology to explore temporal changes in human fibroblast cellular senescence' by Rebekah-Louise Anne Scanlan as part of her PhD at Newcastle University.



ModelA.py, ModelB.py, and CellularSenPaper.py are all python crips to run the computational model. datafiles_graphs.R was used to then visualise the model outputs in R. This work is presented in Chapter 5.

RS_Enrichment_analysis_APTXwork.R is the script used for work in Chapter 6.
